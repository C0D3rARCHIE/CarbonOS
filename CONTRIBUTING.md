## Coding Style
###### Section is under construction.
The quality of one's code is not just in how well it works but also in its readability. Trying to decipher poorly-written code is a waste of time for other contributors. Therefore, these code styling rules should be treated as rules and not as suggestions.

#### Be Consistent
Consistency is the number one rule. Look at the code surrounding yours and try to make it as similar as possible. As said in the [Android Code Style for Contributors](https://source.android.com/source/code-style):
> "The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding, so people can concentrate on what you're saying, rather than on how you're saying it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary, but local style is also important. If the code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Try to avoid this."

#### Use Tabs for Indentation
Please configure your editor to use tabs equivalent to eight spaces to indent blocks of code. Never use spaces.

#### Name Things Well
Make names for your variables, functions, data structures, etc. that properly describe what they do. One-letter variables are acceptable for counters and nothing else.
